# Drawed Trees
I am trying to create an algorithm that can generate trees, with the preservation of the genome and the possibility of crossing.

At the moment, with a low probability, the algorithm is able to generate a plausible tree. 
In addition, trees drawn by the same gnome have slight differences, as if it were in nature.

Earth tree             |  Alien tree
